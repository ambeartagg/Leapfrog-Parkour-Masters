# Leapfrog-Parkour-Masters
 Changed the game so the new goal is to not fall onto the lava floor.
 The first player to touch the floor loses.
 The platforms around the map slowly disappear. After a player collides with a platform it will disappear 2 seconds later, making it more difficult to survive.
